# Try traditional injections

Use API requests that are vulnerable to injection: Send input to be directly executed by the APIâ€™s supporting 
technologies (web application, database, or OS running on the server), bypassing input validation measures.

## Attack tree

```text
1 Discover requests that accept user input (AND)
2 Test for XSS/XAS (AND)
3 Perform database-specific attacks (OR)
4 Perform operating system injection
