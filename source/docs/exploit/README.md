# Introduction

## What?

Leverage vulnerabilities identified to successfully penetrate security controls. Use mostly manual attacks with only
some semi-automated support.

## Why?

Gain access to web services application data and/or permissions (access) not previously available. 

## How?

* [Attack authentication](authentication.md)
* [Exploiting authorisation](authorisation.md)
* [Inject with mass assignment](mass-assignment.md)
* [Try traditional methods](traditional.md)

Exploitation of web services may not be possible given the security controls present, the complexity of the attack 
(undocumented, or not enough documentation/context), and the time allotment for testing.
