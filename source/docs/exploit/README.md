# Introduction

## What?

Check for bad passwords and password requirements, default credentials, verbose error messaging, and bad password 
reset processes, broken API authentication, no authentication whatsoever, a lack of rate limiting applied to 
authentication attempts, the use of a single token or key for all requests, tokens created with insufficient entropy, 
JWT configuration weaknesses, identify resource IDs

## Why?

Many of the gifts that keep giving from web applications for decades have been ported over to APIs, plus then some.

## How?

* [Attack authentication](authentication.md)
* [Exploiting authorisation](authorisation.md)
* [Inject with mass assignment](mass-assignment.md)
* [Try traditional methods](traditional.md)
