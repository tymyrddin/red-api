# Introduction

## What?

Evading or bypassing common API security controls and apply these to test and bypass rate limiting.

## Why?

To be able to trick the API when security controls are in place, such as a WAF that scans requests for common attacks, 
input validation that restricts the type of input, or a rate limit that restricts how many requests can be sent.

## How?

* [Rate limit tests](rate-limit.md)
* [Evasive techniques](evade.md)
