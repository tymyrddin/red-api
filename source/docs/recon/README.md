# Introduction

## What?

Locate the APIs and validate whether they are operational, find credential information (keys, secrets, usernames, 
passwords), version information, API documentation, and information about the APIâ€™s purpose.

## Why?

The more information gathered about a target, the better the odds of discovering and exploiting API-related 
vulnerabilities.

## How?

* [Collect data](collect-data.md)
* [Understand application functionality](functionality.md)
* [Document key parameters](parameters.md)
* [Analyse traffic](traffic.md)
* [Check for exposed secrets](secrets.md)
