# Scanning an API

The BURP Suite API Scanner is only for Enterprise and Professional, and the price is very steep.

Luckily, the ZAP API scan is a script that is available in the [ZAP Docker](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/docker/about/) images.

It is tuned for performing scans against APIs defined by OpenAPI, SOAP, or GraphQL via either a local file or a URL.

It imports the definition that you specify and then runs an Active Scan against the URLs found. The Active Scan 
is tuned to APIs, so it doesnâ€™t bother looking for things like XSSs.

It also includes 2 scripts that:

* Raise alerts for any HTTP Server Error response codes
* Raise alerts for any URLs that return content types that are not usually associated with APIs
