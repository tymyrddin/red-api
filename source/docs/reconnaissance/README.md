# Introduction

## What?

Locate the APIs and validate whether they are operational, find credential information (keys, secrets, usernames, 
passwords), version information, API documentation, and information about the API’s purpose.

## Why?

The more information gathered about a target, the better the odds of discovering and exploiting API-related 
vulnerabilities.

## How?
