# Introduction

## What?

Notes on techniques used for: 

* Leveraging vulnerabilities identified to successfully penetrate security controls, using mostly manual attacks with only some semi-automated support.
* Gaining access to web services application data and/or permissions (access) not previously available.

Note: Exploitation of web services may not be possible given the security controls present, the complexity of the attack (undocumented, or not enough documentation/context), and the time allotment for testing.

## Why?

To overcome the challenges to build a meaningful and sustainable API testing practice.

## How?

* [Challenges](challenges.md)
* [Analyse API endpoints](requests.md)
* [Fuzz deep and wide](fuzzing.md)
* [Rate limit tests](rate-limit.md)
* [Evasive techniques](evade.md)
* [Attack authentication](authentication.md)
* [Exploiting authorisation](authorisation.md)
* [Inject with mass assignment](mass-assignment.md)
* [Try traditional methods](traditional.md)
