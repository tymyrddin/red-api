# Use case propagation

Traditional UI testing is limited to testing the functionality of the application. A tester compares the output of 
a test against expected outcomes. API testing uses a different approach. Being the central hub of logic and the 
gateway to data for (usually several) interfacing applications, the number of use cases in API testing is 
near-infinite. As a results, the number of required tests can rapidly exceed the possible workload of the 
people responsible for test case design.
