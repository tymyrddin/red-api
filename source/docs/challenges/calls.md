# Synchronous and asynchronous methods

One API can link several microservices and other APIs. A single call on an API can produce a load of serial and 
parallel activities. The complexities of an API can grow exponentially when it is combined with other API calls.

Testers then need to take the calling order of APIs into account in the test case design.
